## question : How does MongoDB store data?

## answer: MongoDB stores data in a way that is fundamentally different from traditional relational databases. Instead of using tables and rows, MongoDB stores data in documents, which are flexible, JSON-like objects composed of key-value pairs. These documents are stored in collections, which can be thought of as analogous to tables in a relational database. However, unlike tables, MongoDB collections do not enforce a fixed schema, allowing documents within the same collection to have different structures. This schema-less design provides significant flexibility in managing and evolving data models. A MongoDB document can contain various data types, including nested documents and arrays, enabling complex data structures to be stored and queried directly. For instance, a single document might represent an entity such as a user, with fields for name, email, and an array of addresses, each address being a nested document with its own fields. This contrasts sharply with the relational model, where such data would typically be spread across multiple tables with foreign keys linking them. MongoDB stores its data in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which extends JSON with additional data types and allows for efficient binary encoding of documents. BSON supports the storage of complex data types like dates, regular expressions, and binary data, which are essential for many applications. The choice of BSON allows MongoDB to offer features such as indexing and querying on specific fields within a document, even those nested within arrays or sub-documents. When data is inserted into MongoDB, it is automatically assigned a unique identifier, the _id field, which serves as the primary key. This identifier is usually generated as an ObjectId, a 12-byte identifier that ensures uniqueness across distributed systems. Data retrieval in MongoDB is highly flexible, with support for a wide range of query operators, including comparisons, logical operations, and regular expressions. MongoDB also supports indexing on any field within a document, which significantly speeds up queries. The data storage engine used by MongoDB, typically WiredTiger, provides features like compression, encryption, and support for multi-document ACID transactions, which are crucial for maintaining data integrity in many applications. Overall, MongoDB's data storage model is designed to handle the needs of modern applications that require high flexibility, scalability, and performance.
